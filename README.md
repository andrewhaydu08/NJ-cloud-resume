# NJ-cloud-resume

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands on project that allows individuals to gain a understanding of AWS Architechutres that are foundational to Amazon AWS.
The challenge consists of 16 steps that allows you to create a Static website using Amazon S3 with HTML,CSS. Createing a custom domain with Amazon Route53 and securing the website with HTTPS with amazon Cloud Front.
The Resume has a visitor counter which is implemted with JavaScript and the visitor counter retrieves and updates with DynamoDB. You then ceate an API that communicates with AWS Lambda using Python Coding but you need to write a unittest to verify if your code is correct. To implement the structure of your project you'll use infrastructure as code which will be YAML. It makes everything easier to manange instead of using the AWS console. Then for your backend and frontend you'll need to create a github repo and create CI/CD pipeline with github actions testing your python code with a unittest for the backen and for the frontend you'll do the same that when you push new code to the s3 bucket it changes automatically.
